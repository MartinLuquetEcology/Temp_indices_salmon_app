# Temp_indices_salmon_app
A Shiny app to explore the variation of temperature indices related to the Atlantic salmon in freshwaters.

The app can be found here: https://martinluquetecology.shinyapps.io/salmon_temp_indices/

Please refer to the README.pdf file for a detailed explanation on how it works. For now, the app is only available in French - sorry about that. But if there is interest, it might be translated one day :)
